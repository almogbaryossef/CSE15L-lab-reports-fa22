# Lab Report 3 (Researching Commands)

I have chosen to explore the command "grep". During the lab in week 4, we saw that grep can be used to find all lines in a file that contain a certain string (we used ".txt" to get the paths in the file find-results.txt of .txt files).
The format which we used was: **grep <some string> <file>**. 
However, the command grep can be used in the format **grep <option(s)> <pattern> <file1> <file2> ...**.
